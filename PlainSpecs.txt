1. Logic should look for if any long strings do not include the word input.
2. It should then look for both inputs being the same.
3. After that the logic will see if the word has one instance of that word within the long string.
4. Once that is checked it will check for multiple matches of that word within the long string.
5. Finally it will look for if there are multiple cases of that word within the long string that are exact matches.
